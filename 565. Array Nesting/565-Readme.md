For this question, the Brute Force algorithm is that for each element in the array, we set it as the start point of a selection, and test the whole array. In this method, suppose an element in a selection of size s, then the element in the selection will be visited s times, making the worst time complexity O(n^2). 

We try to find some ways to improve it. We found that for all the element in the same selection, we will go through the same cycle for several times, which is unnecessary. Can we make it simple so that each element and selection will be only visited once? We think that if we use some dictionaries to record all the elements visited, and jump through an element in the biggest cycle, if the element appears in the dictionary, then the problem will be solved.

And can we solve this in place? Yes. Instead of using a dictionary, we can modify the numbers in place, to record that this element has been visited. In my method, I modify the element to 0, and if the number is 0, and it is not the first element, then we can simply jump this element in the main cycle. We choose the sign as "0" because the real element "0" will definitely be visited in the first cycle.
