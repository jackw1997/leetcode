In this question, we are required to find the kth smallest element in a BST. Considering that the BST has already been sorted, so we only need to go throught the sorted BST, travel from the smallest element to find the kth smallest. So we use a stack to realize this function. We pop in the root and all the left nodes of it, so that makes the smallest node at the top of the stack. When we pop an element, we let its right child come in, as well as all the right child's right child, so that the top element will become the second smallest. We continue doing this process, and use a counter to record the no. of the number, and if the counter reaches k, we output the result. The time complexity of this is O(k + logn), and the space complexity is O(logn)
