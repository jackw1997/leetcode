We go through the back to the front. We interatively test whether a point can reach the final. It would be easy to do so, by recording the most front point that can reach the final, and iteratively updating it. We test each point whether it can reach the recorded point, and if it can, we update the recorded point to that point. And finally if the first point is reachable, then we return True, otherwise return False.
